## 2. Product Proposal

Tidied addresses a common issue: the lack of regular room-cleaning habits among youngsters and teens. By offering a visually appealing, easy-to-use app, Tidied encourages users to schedule cleaning reminders and stick to them. The appâ€™s design and functionality are inspired by the iPhone alarm clock, ensuring familiarity and ease of use.

### Target Audience

## 3. Design Process

The design of Tidied was created using **Figma**, focusing on simplicity and functionality. Each feature was planned to align with user habits and expectations.

### Design Flow

1. **Homepage:**

   - A clean layout with a central "Set Timer" button.
   - A "Settings" icon in the top-left corner for future customization (e.g., changing backgrounds).

2. **Alarm Set State:**

   - Once the timer is set, the homepage updates to show "Alarm Set!" with an option to set another timer.

3. **Triggered Alarm Modal:**

   - A full-screen overlay displaying:
     - **Clock Icon:** Positioned in the top-right.
     - **Tidy O'Clock! Message:** Encouraging users to clean their room.
     - **Snooze Button:** Located at the bottom to delay the reminder.
